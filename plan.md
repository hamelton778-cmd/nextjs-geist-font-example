# Blogging Website Development Plan

## 1. API Endpoints

### File: src/app/api/posts/route.ts
- **Purpose:** Handle all blog post data requests.
- **Changes:**
  - Implement a GET handler to return a list of posts (in-memory or from a static file for now).
  - Implement a POST handler to allow creation of new blog posts.
  - Validate input fields (e.g., title, content) and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
  - Add try/catch blocks for error handling and return descriptive error messages.
- **Example Structure:**  
  ```
  export async function GET() { … }
  export async function POST(request: Request) { … }
  ```
- **Best Practice:** Use consistent error responses with status codes 400 for bad requests and 500 for server errors.

## 2. UI Components

### a. Blog Preview Card  
#### File: src/components/blog/PostCard.tsx
- **Purpose:** Render a preview of each blog post.
- **Features:**
  - Show title, an excerpt, publication date, and a clickable link (using Next.js Link) to the detailed view.
  - Use modern typography, clean spacing, and a subtle hover effect.
- **Error Handling:** If required props (title, slug, etc.) are missing, render a fallback message.

### b. Blog Detail Component  
#### File: src/components/blog/PostDetail.tsx
- **Purpose:** Display the full content of a blog post.
- **Features:**
  - Render title, full content, publication date, and any additional metadata.
  - Layout should be easy to read with ample white space and typographic hierarchy.

### c. Blog Post Form  
#### File: src/components/blog/PostForm.tsx
- **Purpose:** Provide a form for creating or editing blog posts.
- **Features:**
  - Use existing UI inputs from your library (e.g., src/components/ui/input.tsx, label.tsx, button.tsx).
  - Fields: Title, Content (textarea), and optionally tags.
  - Validate required fields before submission; show error messages if validation fails.
  - On submit, call the POST API endpoint with proper error handling and loading state.
- **UI/UX:** The form must be modern and clear with consistent spacing, input styling, and clear calls to action.

## 3. Pages & Routing

### a. Blog Listing Page  
#### File: src/app/blog/page.tsx
- **Purpose:** List all blog posts.
- **Changes:**
  - Fetch the list of posts—either via a fetch call to /api/posts or from a static module in src/lib/posts.ts.
  - Render a grid or list of PostCard components.
  - Include a header with the blog’s name and navigation links (e.g., “Home”, “Write New Post”).
  - Handle the “no posts available” scenario with a friendly message.

### b. Blog Detail Page  
#### File: src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
- **Purpose:** Show the detailed view of a single blog post.
- **Changes:**
  - Use Next.js dynamic routing to extract the slug.
  - Fetch post details (from API or static store) and render the PostDetail component.
  - Return a 404 error view if the post is not found.

### c. Admin New Post Page  
#### File: src/app/admin/new/page.tsx
- **Purpose:** Provide an interface for creating a new blog post.
- **Changes:**
  - Render the PostForm component.
  - Optionally integrate basic authentication checks (document in code comments how to integrate real auth later).
  - Handle state changes during submission and display success/error notifications.

---

## 4. Styling and Global Updates

### File: src/app/globals.css
- **Changes:**
  - Define new CSS classes for blog-specific layouts (e.g., card layouts, form styles, headers).
  - Apply responsive design rules to ensure readability on mobile and desktop.
  - Use modern color schemes and spacing to enhance UI consistency.
- **Best Practice:** Keep the global styles modular and consider using CSS variables for colors and spacing for easy adjustments.

---

## 5. Data Handling and Utility Functions

### File: src/lib/posts.ts
- **Purpose:** Create a module for in-memory or static blog post data.
- **Changes:**
  - Export functions to fetch all posts and fetch a post by slug.
  - Include error handling if a post isn’t found.
- **Best Practice:** Document that this module should be replaced later with a database adapter for production use.

---

## 6. README and Documentation

### File: README.md
- **Changes:**
  - Update the README to include instructions on running the blog, API endpoint usage, and any assumptions made (e.g., static in-memory posts).
  - Document how to extend the blog with persistent data or authentication.

---

## 7. Testing & Error Handling

- **Testing API endpoints:**  
  - Use curl commands to send GET and POST requests to /api/posts and validate responses (status codes and data).
- **UI Tests:**  
  - Ensure navigation from the blog listing page to the detail view works correctly.
  - Validate that error messages appear for invalid form submissions.
- **Best Practice:** Log errors to the console and consider adding user-friendly error boundaries in production.

## Summary

- Created a new API route (src/app/api/posts/route.ts) to manage blog posts with proper error handling.  
- Implemented modern UI components in src/components/blog/ (PostCard, PostDetail, PostForm) that integrate with existing UI slots.  
- Developed pages in src/app/ (blog listing, dynamic blog details, and admin new post) to provide a complete blogging experience.  
- Updated global styles (src/app/globals.css) with responsive, modern design practices.  
- Integrated data handling via a new utility module (src/lib/posts.ts) with clear placeholders for future enhancements.  
- Added thorough error handling and validation on both the API and UI forms.  
- Updated README.md for clear documentation and future extensibility.
